# SimplePaintApp

Instructions:
App should be written using Plain JavaScript & HTML - no third party libraries like KineticJS or jQuery should be used.
The Assignment is divided into two modules and both of them carry equal weightage. 
Once both the modules are done, you can add any new feature to the same.
Do not copy from other sources or do not post solutions online (like GitHub, jsFiddle, etc.) - if we get multiple answers with similar code, all of them will be rejected. 
Note: 
Module 1 and Module 2 should be implemented in the same application and not in two different files.


Module 1: 

Create a Simple Paint App using HTML5 Canvas Element that lets users to draw Triangles on the canvas by clicking & dragging the mouse - like in Windows Paint App
Size of Triangles should depend on how much the user drags the mouse.
Automatically fill each Triangle with a different color
Add a clear / reset button that clears the canvas

Module 2:
Add feature to drag Triangles using Mouse
If the mouse is being dragged on an existing Triangle, drag the same or else create a new one.
Double clicking on a Triangle should delete the same.
